### Hi there, I'm Alisa ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been pursuing a software engineer career after becoming fascinated by the intersection of medicine and tech at my last position. This lead me to Hack Reactor where I learned JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, and more. Now, I'm on the hunt for a dynamic team to tackle healthcare and tech challenges together!
